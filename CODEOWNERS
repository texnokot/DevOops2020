 These owners will be the default owners for everything in
# the repo. Unless a later match takes precedence,
# @texnokot will be requested for
# review when someone opens a pull request.
*       @texnokot

# Order is important; the last matching pattern takes the most
# precedence. When someone opens a pull request that only
# modifies JS files, only @texnokot and not the global
# owner(s) will be requested for a review.
*.js    @texnokot

# You can also use email addresses if you prefer. They'll be
# used to look up users just like we do for commit author
# emails.
*.go texnokot@gmail.com

# In this example, @doctocat owns any files in the build/logs
# directory at the root of the repository and any of its
# subdirectories.
/build/logs/ @texnokot

# The `docs/*` pattern will match files like
# `docs/getting-started.md` but not further nested files like
# `docs/build-app/troubleshooting.md`.
docs/*  texnokot@gmail.com

# In this example, @texnokot owns any file in an apps directory
# anywhere in your repository.
apps/ @texnokot

# In this example, @texnokot owns any file in the `/docs`
# directory in the root of your repository and any of its
# subdirectories.
/docs/ @texnokot
